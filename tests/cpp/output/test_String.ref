Testing gslStrcpy:
- Expected result: abcde
- Result = abcde
Testing gslStrcat:
- Expected result: abcdefgh
- Result = abcdefgh
Testing gslSPrintf:
- Expected result: A+fgh
- Result(char) = A+fgh
Testing gslSPrintf2:
- Expected result: BC+fgh
- Result(char) = BC+fgh
Testing gslAddSPrintf2:
- Result(char) = BC+fgh added 1 times
Testing gslStrcat2:
- Result(char) = BC+fgh added 1 times (Tested successfully)
Testing gslStrcpy2:
- Result(char) = After a copy
